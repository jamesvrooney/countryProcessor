You are required to write a program which processes country data records by a number of different properties.

A country data file contains a header line, followed by zero or more data lines, in comma-separated value format.
The data lines are not guaranteed to be in any particular order.

An example file is:

    country_id,name,population,continent
    1,Mongolia,8315282,ASIA
    2,Estonia,17382216,EUROPE
    3,Equatorial Guinea,5949415,AFRICA

The features which you must implement have been prototyped in the class com.sedex.test.CountryProcessor.
    - They are:
        - groupCountriesByContinent
        - groupFilteredCountriesByContinent
        - populationByContinent
        - getMostPopulatedCountryByContinent

We would like to see all the test cases passing.

The time allotted to the test is 1 hour. Your solution will be judged on a number of criteria pertinent to good
software development practice. Incomplete solutions are acceptable.
